# Eclipse Engine
WIP Friday Night Funkin' Engine made in [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/)!

It's **very** unfinished, because I made this to help myself learn a bit about coding.

***Any and all coding help is appreciated!!!***

## TO DO:
- [ ] Input system rewrite (It's fucking atrocious)
- [ ] Proper game over + fix bugs (The few there are... oh how awful they are!)
- [ ] Save which stage you select in Chart Editor and have it use it in PlayScene
- [ ] Get song events working
- [ ] Port the other weeks
- [ ] Finish character editor
- [ ] Rework editor ui's to make them cooler + more simple under the hood n functional
- [ ] Make the engine generally more flexiible with gameplay and stuff
- [ ] Adobe Animate/Flash spritemap support(?)
